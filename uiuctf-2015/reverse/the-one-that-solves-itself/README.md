# UIU CTF 2015: The One That Solves Itself

**Category:** Reverse
**Points:** 400
**Solves:** 1
**Description:** 

> RE: We think we've got something revolutionary here and are glad you signed up to try it. Please allow us to introduce (what might be) the world's first self-solving CTF challenge! All you need to do is run this handy-dandy malwa^H^H^H^H^Hkey retrieval tool and wait. The flag will be revealed to you with no effort required on your part! It just might not get there until the some time on 4/5.
> 
> Notes:
> -The challenge is written to simulate malware. It's not "supposed to" do any actual damage, however it will exhibit some malware-like behaviours. Running the code in a safe environment (like a VM) is advised. In the event you don't have one available, check out modern.ie.
> 
> -In the event you need to remove the challenge, simply kill it from your task manager of choice and then re-run it with the single argument '1' (ex. CTFMalware.exe 1)
> 
> -Most files that the malware will fetch only exist for a brief window, but the files containing the keys will be accessible for the duration of the event. You just need to find them. Or let the [malware](CTFMalware.exe) do it for you.
