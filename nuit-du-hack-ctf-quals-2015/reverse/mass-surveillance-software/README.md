> Here is the song: "Every mail you send. Every call you make. Every file you save. Every thought you save. I'm recording you.
> 
> With anyone you play. anywhere you stay. any place you check. any move you make. I'll be watching you. Oh can't you see. you belong to me. no more privacy. R.I.P democracy.
> 
> Every doc you leak. Every link you click. Every fight you take. Every step you make. We'll be watching you.
> 
> Since you're online i save every trace. You think you're hidden but i can see your face. You look around but you're doomed we're in thge place. You feel so cold and i love to feel your stress. I'm recording, recording, so baby, cheese.

> Oh can't you see. You belong to me. No more privacy. R.I.P. Democracy. Every single word. Picture of your friends. And friends of your friends. All around the world.
